# PianoBooster plus Kory

This repository was created from PianoBooster at sourceforge.net by
using,

    git svn clone 'svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/pianobooster/code/trunk'

... and applying Horkan Smith's copy of a color patch from
PianoBooster forum user, Kory.

The intention is for this repository to facilitate collaboration on
minimal changes before presenting them to the upstream maintainers.
